This project comprises several Python scripts utilizing the Matplotlib library to create graphical visualizations. Each script generates different types of plots, such as bar charts and line graphs, using predefined datasets. Each graph has titles, labels on the X and Y axes, and, when applicable, legends to distinguish data groups.
